    Glyne- I've added a makefile that helps compile the code. Using this file is very 
            easy. If you don't already have it, install make to your computer.
                https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
            You need to have a makefile in your directory that tells make how to compile
            your code.
            
            Why is `make` needed?
            
            I have `make` set up so that it will always compile using c++11. It also has
            some flags to make debugging clearer. Intead of having to type:
            
            g++ -std=c++11 Inventory -o Inventory.o
            
            you type: 
            
            make
            
            That's all! It will compile the files and output them as [filename].o
